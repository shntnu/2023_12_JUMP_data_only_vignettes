# Glossary and Acronyms

Reference for terms and their definition.

- **Morphological profiling** (aka image-based profiling): Method to study cell phenotypes by quantifying their shape, size and intensity features.
- **Phenotypic activity**: Metric that indicates how well can we distinguish a perturbation from its negative controls [ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11014546/).
- **Phenotypic consistency**: Metric that indicates how well does a perturbation match an annotated resource (e.g., gene-target known interactions).
- **Phenotypic distinctiveness**: Metric showing how distinctive a perturbation is relative to the other perturbations in a given experiment.
- **Cosine similarity**: Metric correlated to how close two vectors are. It assumes all the elements in them (usually features) have the same weight.
- **Retrievability: Umbrella term for the methods that assess the quality of matching among a set of samples in a profiling experiment**: phenotypic activity, consistency and distinctiveness.
- **Consensus profile**: Aggregated profiles across all biological replicates (e.g., across all wells) of a given perturbation, generally it is the median of every feature.

## Acronyms

- **JUMP**: Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling
- **mAP**: mean Average Precision
- **CRISPR**: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. This method was used to produce the CRISPR datasets, whence genes were knocked-out.
- **ORF**: Open Reading Frame. The ORF dataframe is comprised of overexpressed genes.

## Other definitions

These definitions are related to [cytomining](https://github.com/cytomining) libraries and may not be relevant to the more recent tools. They are kept here in case you encounter them in papers/metadata.

- **poscon\_diverse**: Other positive controls, this is experiment-specific.
- **poscon\_cp**: Standard positive control used for compound studies(cp stands for compound probes).
- **q-value: Expected False Discovery Rate (FDR)**: the proportion of false positives among all positive results.
