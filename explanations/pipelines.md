# Computational Pipelines

## Image Processing Pipeline

CellProfiler pipelines for segmentation and feature extraction as well as QC and illumination correction can be found on [Github here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/imaging-platform-pipelines/tree/master/JUMP_production).

## Profile Generation

The complete workflow for processing CellProfiler features (including annotation, normalization, and feature selection) is documented in the [`jump-profiling-recipe`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/jump-profiling-recipe) repository.
Version [v0.1.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/jump-profiling-recipe/releases/tag/v0.1.0) was used to generate the processed profiles available in this dataset.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning based workflows are under construction. Future plans include:

- Deep learning embeddings using a pre-trained neural network (EfficientNet V2) for all 4 datasets
